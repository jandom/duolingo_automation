# Duolingo Automation
A Selenium-based project that automates signing in and translating basic Duolingo tasks.

This will get you lots of points on Duolingo, and in turn will make you Very Cool.

Make sure you have selenium installed
`pip install selenium`

Edit duolingo.py with your username and password.

Change translations.py to whichever language you'd like. German by default :D
